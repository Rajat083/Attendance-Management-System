ER Diagram Description:

Entities:
- Student (Roll No. (PK), Name, Contact_No, Email)
- Course (Course_ID (PK), Course_Name)
- Faculty (Faculty_ID (PK), Name, Department, Contact_No, Email)
- Attendance (Attendance_ID (PK), Date, Status, Lecture_No)

Relationships:
- Student takes Course: Many-to-Many relationship, resolved using the Attendance table.
- Course is taught by Faculty: Many-to-One relationship (resolved by Faculty_ID in Course entity)
- Student has Attendance: One-to-Many relationship (resolved by Student_Roll_No in Attendance entity)
- Course has Attendance: One-to-Many relationship (resolved by Course_ID in Attendance entity)

Foreign Keys:
- Student.Course_ID references Course.Course_ID
- Course.Faculty_ID references Faculty.Faculty_ID
- Attendance.Student_Roll_No references Student.Roll_No
- Attendance.Course_ID references Course.Course_ID

Table Schema:

1. Student (Roll_No VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(255), Course_ID INT, Contact_No VARCHAR(20), Email VARCHAR(255), FOREIGN KEY (Course_ID) REFERENCES Course(Course_ID))

2. Course (Course_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Course_Name VARCHAR(255), Faculty_ID INT, FOREIGN KEY (Faculty_ID) REFERENCES Faculty(Faculty_ID))

3. Faculty (Faculty_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(255), Department VARCHAR(255), Contact_No VARCHAR(20), Email VARCHAR(255))

4. Attendance (Attendance_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Student_Roll_No VARCHAR(255), Course_ID INT, Date DATE, Status VARCHAR(10), Lecture_No INT, FOREIGN KEY (Student_Roll_No) REFERENCES Student(Roll_No), FOREIGN KEY (Course_ID) REFERENCES Course(Course_ID))

Normalization:
The current database schema is designed to be in 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
- Each table has a primary key.
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key (1NF and 2NF).
- There are no transitive dependencies (3NF), meaning no non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute.

Procedures:

1. Add_Student:
   CREATE PROCEDURE Add_Student (
       @Roll_No VARCHAR(255),
       @Name VARCHAR(255),
       @Course_ID INT,
       @Contact_No VARCHAR(20),
       @Email VARCHAR(255)
   )
   AS
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO Student (Roll_No, Name, Course_ID, Contact_No, Email)
       VALUES (@Roll_No, @Name, @Course_ID, @Contact_No, @Email);
   END;

2. Record_Attendance:
   CREATE PROCEDURE Record_Attendance (
       @Student_Roll_No VARCHAR(255),
       @Course_ID INT,
       @Date DATE,
       @Status VARCHAR(10),
       @Lecture_No INT
   )
   AS
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO Attendance (Student_Roll_No, Course_ID, Date, Status, Lecture_No)
       VALUES (@Student_Roll_No, @Course_ID, @Date, @Status, @Lecture_No);
   END;

3. Get_Student_Attendance:
   CREATE PROCEDURE Get_Student_Attendance (

   )
   AS
   BEGIN
       SELECT s.Name, c.Course_Name, a.Date, a.Status, a.Lecture_No
       FROM Student s
       JOIN Attendance a ON s.Roll_No = a.Student_Roll_No

   SELECT a.Date, a.Status, a.Lecture_No
   FROM Attendance a
   WHERE a.Student_Roll_No = '[RollNo]' AND a.Course_ID = [CourseID];

3. Get the total number of present and absent days for a student in a course:
   SELECT
       SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TotalPresent,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Absent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TotalAbsent
   FROM Attendance
   WHERE Student_Roll_No = '[RollNo]' AND Course_ID = [CourseID];

4. Get all courses taught by a specific faculty member:
   SELECT c.Course_ID, c.Course_Name
   FROM Course c
   JOIN Faculty f ON c.Faculty_ID = f.Faculty_ID
   WHERE f.Name = '[FacultyName]';
